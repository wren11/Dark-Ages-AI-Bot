# Dark Ages AI: pop

## Overview
**Dark Ages AI: pop** — This here's the nuttiest, dumbest thing I ever spat out: crammin' AI into some ancient MMORPG just for the heck of it. Dreamt it up outta pure spite and a deep, burning loathing for them no-good arena botting fools and  desi programmers in Dark Ages.

## Features
- **Packet Pranks:** Messing with internet thingies for the LOLs.
- **Overlay Overkill:** Smashing the screen with too much stuff because why not?
- **Scripting Shenanigans:** Sneakily using code spells to do sneaky things.
- **AI:** Making smart bots question their life choices or just annoy their creators.

## Disclaimer
This ain't just a bad idea—it's THE worst idea, mate.
